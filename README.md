# Efficient and Scalable Algorithms for Optimizing the Average Silhouette Width

This R-package (EfficientOASW v.0.0.0.9000) implements the computationally expensive Optimum Silhouette (OSil) clustering algorithm, which is computed in $\mathcal{O}(kN^3)$ time, and provides an $\mathcal{O}(N)$ faster implementation of the exact OSil algorithm (effOSil). A new scalable approximation algorithm of OSil (scalOSil) and PAMSil will be provided in the next releases.
